                        She was trying to overcome a difficult situation when someone dropped ‘Hi’ in her Inbox. She
                        ignores it until she was
                        down to a couple of drinks. She responds to the chat not knowing what this can lead to. This
                        happens not just when we
                        meet strangers online but in other areas of our lives as well - workplaces, public transport,
                        malls, etc. You feel as if
                        you can talk to the person forever because you both go well together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>They also have struck a chord in an unimaginably beautiful way </strong>. Chatting and
                        talking they
                        discovered that they could be
                        perfect for each other in many ways if not all. Their vibe matched like two gears just rolling
                        perfectly in sync, no
                        force required. She was trying to fill a void so this boy acted as a perfect filler for her. And
                        from a simple ‘Hi, how
                        are you?’ things grew multifold, emotions grew multifold. They both started reading and
                        understanding each other’s
                        minds. Then what is stopping them from being together?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>She is already committed to another person and so is he </strong>, still best part of
                        their
                        discussions
                        was honesty and
                        transparency, they both knew this fact. Two ingredients - When you have no intention of selling
                        yourself and you are
                        talking to a stranger just to say and listen then you see the real you, no manipulations or
                        filters in thoughts, no
                        secrets, no lies and that’s the purest form. It might be difficult to find such connections but
                        when you find it is
                        difficult to resist and stop the flow. You have found another You.
                    </p>

                        He shared snaps, videos, and posts to express his way of life, outlook, and concept of intimacy.
                        And she could relate to
                        every single one of them. And all of it drew both of them even close. When you realize you are
                        crossing the line, you
                        discuss the things you should not do when you are already with someone, conflict begins that
                        what is right and what is
                        wrong. There are guiding principles, the social norms so that people don’t go crazy. But haven’t
                        you ever felt just
                        stomping these freaking norms and moving on proudly with this person who looks like your world?
                        These questions are to make you aware that it is not an easy story and it has no ending till you
                        want to give it
                        one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> One thing She realized throughout this journey was that you can fall for two persons at
                            the same
                            time, maybe a little
                            less or a little more than the other one but it doesn’t matter </strong>, She needed both of
                        them. The
                        same was the case for him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one can deny that two minds live in one body, one will always tell you to behave, to listen
                        to society’s rules and
                        respect, and to spend your entire life with one person, let’s call this part <strong> White
                        </strong>. Then there
                        is another part that
                        understands what you need and has no respect for society’s principles. It agrees with you to
                        give yourself completely to
                        that other person, let’s call this part <strong> Black </strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To inhibit and to stay sane she was taking commands from White more often but wanted to give in
                        too. When she was drunk
                        she was ready to erase the boundaries created by White and embrace the Black and she loved those
                        moments and longed for
                        them later. His side was no different, like I said they became one. The chats were so
                        pleasurable that they had already
                        imagined a trip, we all know what can happen over a trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was winter and they went to a hilly place. The first such meeting ever. Butterflies in the
                        stomach. He was looking
                        into her eyes, her heart was racing, and she chose to not look into the eyes as it makes her
                        lose control. White was
                        suggesting ways to keep the meeting as usual as possible, just two people meeting each other. A
                        clash had started
                        between White and Black, Black was happy and was expanding itself gracefully as if it knew the
                        ending. White already
                        felt defeated and was just holding somehow. As evening approached the chill also caught up. They
                        decided to stay near
                        the bonfire put up by the Hotel. They held drinks and watched the fire in front of them holding
                        more fire inside them.
                        They talked less and felt each other’s presence more holding hands and their drinks. They stood
                        up for a stroll. <strong> She can
                            trade anything for this feeling, walking beside him and holding his hands </strong>. They
                        smoked and sat
                        next to the bonfire for
                        some more time before they decided to go to their room. Why on earth they booked two separate
                        rooms, this trip was meant
                        to bring them closer. They smoked followed by a passionate kiss and the night went on.
                        Imagination!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s the beauty of imagination, there is no one to police around, no rail guards, and you can
                        create your most
                        beautiful time the way you want. Similarly, they both had imagined this trip in their ways.
                        <strong> Ultimately, if you get a
                            chance what would you suggest to these souls? To go on a trip or just keep imagining or stop
                            and
                            accept White. </strong>

                    <p>
                        Leaving for now with that thought. Thanks for the read.
