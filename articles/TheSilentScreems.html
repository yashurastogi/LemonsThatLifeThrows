                    <p>
                        <i> To make better sense I suggest you to read the story <a
                                href="../articles/WhiteBlack.html">(‘White and Black’) </a> published before this one…
                        </i>
                        <br>
                        Now this story
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is busy in his daily tasks and as per the routine takes care of office calls, and does his
                        job with his whole heart.
                        He is in a relationship and they are just like any other couple. They have their fights, their
                        romances, and their usual
                        stuff. He loves her from her whole heart, completely unaware that she might be sharing her love
                        with someone else too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But he can sense little changes in her behavior like she was not giving him enough of her time,
                        like that charm was
                        missing like she was not interested in him anymore. The mere thought shakes him so he tries to
                        avoid these thoughts as
                        much as possible but glaring changes will ask him to return to questioning mode – has he done
                        any mistake? What happened
                        all of sudden? Why she does not speak to him as she used to- fully involved and creating new
                        topics from one topic,
                        where did that depth go and why? He was yearning for answers day in and day out! The saddest
                        part was that he had no one
                        to discuss this feeling with even if he had someone what has he got to say? <strong>Those were
                            just the silent screams.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His clouded thoughts made him do things to please her, more attempts and then more attempts to
                        show what they had and
                        what it can turn into. There is a very subtle amount of balance needed in relationships when you
                        are not a control freak
                        and when you also do not let everything go.
                        <strong>
                            There is nothing like perfect relationships or successful relationships, one
                            needs to MAKE it successful and perfect. </strong> Among the mantras for making a
                        relationship successful one is about giving the
                        right amount of freedom and space to your partner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What will happen when he will cross paths with this truth? Will he be able to hold his demeanor
                        or will he burst? When
                        others will come to know about this will they feel pity for the boy and hate the girl?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that he fears the worse he was trying to bring the pieces together, trying to relive those
                        old memories with her,
                        desperately creating opportunities to be together as much as possible but he forgot that holding
                        sand tightly will only
                        make it fall. He was ready to accept and apologize without questions if he did something wrong,
                        but she never presented
                        and gave him a chance to understand what was wrong. Actually, there was nothing wrong yet from
                        any of the sides,
                        <strong>
                            both
                            were exploring. He explored where he went wrong, she explored the novelty she found.
                        </strong> But there
                        was no conclusion yet.
                        But he felt like sinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Why relationship commitments are hard? </strong> One has to give full support to make it
                        successful when
                        one gets into a
                        commitment just like an investor in a new venture would do. And just to clarify, commitment
                        cannot be shared if one
                        shares the commitment that’s not the true meaning of commitment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also true that one might feel getting stuck with the wrong person but there is no reason to
                        justify cheating in
                        commitments. If you are in doubt, get clarity and follow the process to come out of it but no
                        one has the right to play
                        with the emotions of others. One way to keep checking if you are doing right or wrong imagine
                        yourself in other shoes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unable to figure it out and with the constant fear of losing her, he is not able to sleep, he
                        waits for her to text back
                        like she usually did, to discuss things they used to discuss, and he weeps silently. He became
                        more alert and started
                        asking her questions, about her day, about how she felt, about if there was something he can do
                        for her. How much ever
                        he did there were no timely responses but even there was no indication that something is ending.
                        In a hope that things
                        will get better between them I am ending this story with respectable Gulzar’s Shayari which
                        reverberates well with the
                        guy’s state right now waiting for her to reply:
                        <br>
                        <strong> “Raat ne fir runn jeet liya hai aaj ka din phir haar gaya hoon” </strong> (Night has
                        won the fight again today, the day has lost
                        again).
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take care of yourself and your loved ones.
                        <br>
