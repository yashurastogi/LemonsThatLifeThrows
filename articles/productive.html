                        My colleague, to me one evening : “Hey, I have been trying to complete this file since morning
                        and still I am only half
                        done.”
                        <br>
                        Me: “Is it too big to finish in a day?”
                        <br>
                        Colleague: “That’s the thing, it is not too big. I could have easily finished it today”


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever been in a situation as my colleague above? At least I have been. So why do you
                        think people can’t finish
                        one file the whole day? The answer is distractions. In today’s time when we have all things
                        there could be to distract
                        us, this type of situation has become normal. Your notification tone chimes when you are in the
                        middle of closing
                        something. Now since most of us are working from home, focussing on a task is even difficult.
                        You need to balance two
                        worlds - office & home and complete your tasks.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Easy to reach and instant messaging apps in our life today creates a <strong> fake sense of
                            urgency</strong>. Many times giving a cooling
                        period helps. When my peers ping me and I ping them back immediately there's a minimum 5-15
                        minutes of discussion. But,
                        if I did not see that message instantly and I pinged back after 30 minutes or so, I would hear
                        that the issue doesn’t
                        exist anymore. Conversation ends.<strong> This is the magic of the cooling period </strong>


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, I will discuss some of the <strong> practical ways that can make us more productive
                        </strong>. Let’s categorize broadly in what
                        areas these distractions come and then look at the solutions.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Battleground #1: Office </strong> <br> You may be trying to close that one file but
                        some or the other meeting pop-up, ping from colleague, worry about other
                        pending tasks etc. distract you. We start switching back and forth which breaks the momentum and
                        kills the efficiency
                        otherwise we had working regularly on something. You can do below to tackle Office distractions:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Set ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode</strong> in the chat software of your organisation. It
                            will still allow you to receive all the
                            notifications, but silently, and you can cater to them when you want to. Now you do not need
                            to bother about constant
                            pings that you receive.</li>
                        <li>Give a <strong>cooling period</strong> to a new event instead of jumping into it right away.
                        </li>
                        <li>If possible, <strong>group all the meetings in one half</strong> of your whole day and leave
                            the other half for your work. We already know it is difficult to work on something while the
                            next meeting is in 10-15 mins. Having one type of task grouped together builds efficiency.
                            You can even have no meeting
                            day.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Take productive breaks instead of irregular ones.</strong>Say no to any physical,
                            virtual distraction if you are not on break.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Change your alert/notifications settings</strong>for all work related apps on your
                            phone. You can actually time a window to receive notifications so you don’t get them
                            when you are off work or on holiday.

                        </li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        You can actually <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/COIQwzrnLq9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"
                            target="_blank">watch this
                            video</a> to understand that multitasking does not help.

                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Battleground #2: Home </strong> <br> Working from home gives a lot of flexibility but
                        also brings many challenges. You are in an important meeting when your
                        kid comes to ask you something or your wife asks from behind when the meeting is going to get
                        over? These are very small
                        incidents but have big impacts. <strong> They distract and break your attention </strong>.
                        Recent researches have
                        said that the <strong> average
                            attention span of humans is constantly dropping </strong> and now it is only 8 seconds -
                        which means your
                        mind cannot stand still
                        on a single thought for more than 8 seconds and you forcefully need to bring the attention back.
                        The trending apps like-
                        tik tok, reels, youtube shorts are based on this attention span model. The shorter the videos
                        are the better is the
                        chance for users to stay longer. But just imagine the repercussions it has. What we can do to
                        save ourselves from home
                        distractions:

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Decide a place</strong> for yourself to sit and work. When you have a particular
                            spot for particular tasks your efficiency increases. The
                            location has energy. That’s why we are told not to study sitting on beds, we can get sleep
                            faster during studying.
                        </li>
                        <li>Set <strong>time boundaries to attend office and home work</strong> separately. Do not start
                            your morning by looking at the emails. You cannot bring any change by going through your
                            emails.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Build a routine.</strong> Defining a time for when to have breakfast, when to sit
                            with family members, from when to when you wish to work. Time
                            has memory. Do not mix and match and avoid overlap as much as possible.

                            day.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Enjoy your weekends.</strong>There can be a chance that you need to do office work
                            for sometime over the weekend that’s completely fine until you
                            decide for how many hours you will work. Structuring your day saves you from a lot of
                            frustration & time wastage.

                        </li>

                        <strong> Battleground #3: Smart Phones </strong> <br> Smart phones probably are the best tool
                        one can have to achieve almost anything, if used wisely. When we start using the
                        phone and stick with it even after our job is done and start doing mindless scrolling, that's
                        when the <strong> phone starts using us.</strong>.
                        We have seen and heard enough on how misuse of smart phones is making human dumb, inactive and
                        lazy. We already know how
                        this tool becomes an addiction, but we can’t deny how important smartphones are. Hence, there’s
                        a need to learn to
                        balance the usage of the same. Let’s see how we can do it.



                    <ol>
                        <li>Understand the <strong> problem is not the smartphones</strong> but the variety of apps in
                            it. Some apps have made lives easy for example: cab booking apps, grocery delivery apps,
                            medical consultation apps, job search apps etc. but many apps like: short videos apps,
                            gaming apps, social media apps
                            etc. are doing the harm. To prevent yourself from getting immersed with these apps, set a
                            time limit using your phone
                            settings.<strong>Once that pop -up comes, be
                                determined to exit the app.</strong> I did it with a few apps and I can say it saved me
                            from
                            getting addicted.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor your screen time every week.</strong> Almost all the phones now offer this
                            facility to measure screen time and distribution of the time among various apps.
                            This will help you rationalize the app usage.

                        </li>
                        <li>Do not use the phone for at least 4 hours in a day and do not use it 2 hours before bed. I
                            know this can seem impossible
                            but try it to see the difference. Lesser availability on the phone makes life peaceful and
                            simple.
                        </li>



                    </ol>

                        I wish the points mentioned here really bring some long lasting changes in your daily life. I am
                        following these tips
