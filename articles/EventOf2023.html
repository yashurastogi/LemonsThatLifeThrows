            What does it feel like to start something of your own? Mere thought of it excites you, gives you chills, you
            can feel
            that gush of blood run through your systems and once you actually start this journey you will experience the
            extremes of
            both the emotions - high and dull, positive and negative.
            Before and after starting your business is totally different, at least it was for me. Where in the beginning
            you are full
            of energy, you go extra miles to get your idea out of mind and put it in the real world. You might feel a
            little drained
            down when you have actually put it out there but in a way that’s totally fine, in all your endeavors what
            matters most
            is that you kept going, you kept crawling despite all the negativity and challenges trying to pull you back.

            This piece of blog is going to be very special to me because it narrates one of the bravest things I have
            done in my
            life and I am very proud of myself irrespective of the destiny of it, and destiny my friend, is a very
            subjective term.


          </p>
          <p>
            The inception of MyTeez was somewhere around November- December of 2022 when I started researching about the
            t-shirts
            market and as it would have looked like to you this seemed to me a product that will never go out of fashion
            or let’s
            say indispensable to any consumer of this planet. I narrowed down the idea of offering quirky, funny prints
            on good
            quality t-shirts. Now if you read that sentence again from an application point of view, every word that I
            used there is
            a world in itself, figuring out the designs, the high quality t-shirts, the whole shipping methods,
            maintaining
            inventory etc. the paraphernalia of this what seems like a simple business can bewilder you. Hardly 2 months
            into it and
            I realized it is not going to be a piece of cake as I had assumed it to be plus I had a full time job. This
            business
            asked for all the skills I acquired so far working at different jobs, different roles. It was time for me to
            apply those
            skills and become self-disciplined and be my own beacon and keep going to make it successful. I know you can
            relate to
            it if you have ever attempted something similar.


          </p>
          <p>
            In 2 months I was clear with the idea, my husband then joined me and assisted me on whole lot of things
            (honestly
            speaking he had something of his own cooking up in his mind, he wished to open a cafe/restaurant, and that
            dream is
            still alive in his heart somewhere, I genuinely wish we get to fulfill that dream very soon). After sometime
            me and my
            better half were working equally together, putting all our thoughts on how to make MyTeez a reality and then
            we were
            joined by one of his friends and then the trio started brainstorming day in and day out. There were umpteen
            number of
            tasks ahead of us like finding sources to get the inventory, meeting with vendors, procuring samples,
            testing quality,
            color, etc. and then ultimately zeroing down on one of them and fixing the quantities and sizes needed.
            Trust me, it all
            can be and was so overwhelming and that’s where the support of your family plays a critical role and this is
            one area
            where I consider myself very lucky. All these preparations took some 6 months and we officially launched
            MyTeez in June
            2023. Now it was time to show the world what has been brewing inside our heads. This is the <a
              href="https://myteez.in/">Website
              of MyTeez. </a>

          <p>

            There is so much more to tell about this journey, it will need another blogpost I am sure (<a
              href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1ebLsDvjFz/?igsh=MW5haTJ2eXlxbzV6eg%3D%3D">you
              can see this
              video</a>).
            But
            I will end it here. From a business world point of view the journey has just begun but from an
            entrepreneurship point of
            view I lived decades in the past months. I am very excited about the journey ahead. Wish me all the best and
            see you in
            the next one very soon.
