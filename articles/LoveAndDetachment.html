                    <p>
                        Are you confusing Love with attachment ? I think most of us do. When you start enjoying the
                        company of someone, start
                        liking their ways and your rhyming goes well with them it can be misunderstood as love. It may
                        or may not be love, it
                        can be attachment and people can confuse that with love. When you are attached to someone, you
                        have expectations and
                        when it is not fulfilled you feel pain but love is not supposed to make you feel pain. The
                        question is how can you
                        love without being attached? By not keeping expectations. That’s why love is also characterised
                        by being selfless - you
                        don’t need anything for you in return. The person you love and care for will automatically love
                        you back if that’s not
                        happening, I doubt you should spend any of your time and energy there. So do not ask for love.
                        It is clear that love is
                        not supposed to give you pain. Now let’s try to understand detachment.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the times people get confused about DETACHMENT. They generally think detachment as
                        separating themselves from
                        others who can impact them and thus living kind of unimpacted but in the words of Ali,
                        <strong>“detachment is not that you own
                            nothing, but that nothing should own you.” </strong> <a style="text-decoration: none;  "
                            href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COtuiIAHPs4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"
                            target="_blank">See and share
                            with
                            your loved
                            ones.</a>
                        This lovely line is magical. Detachment
                        is when you care about things &
                        people but you don’t lose yourself in that process. You use that luxurious car for a ride but do
                        not become unstable if
                        it is lost one day, you love your family members and care for them but when they leave this
                        earth you understand it and
                        maintain the stability. You own everything but still own nothing - that’s detachment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now when <strong> we combine Love and detachment it creates magic.</strong> Just imagine how
                        beautiful it would be
                        that you devote your
                        time and energy for someone or into something but when that person or that thing ceases to exist
                        you maintain your calm.
                        Easier said than done but that is the life we should aspire for.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Everyone loves their life and fears losing it- but imagine if we learn to love in a detached
                        manner we will start
                        enjoying each and every moment without fear, we can try things which scares us because in the
                        words of Buddha, <strong>“fear
                            doesn’t prevent death, it prevents life.” </strong>The anchor of your happiness should not
                        be fixed to
                        external things or people.
                        We all know nothing is permanent, everyone will leave this planet some or the other day so why
                        not do what makes you
                        happy and live in a detached way till we are here. On the deathbed you will not remember the big
                        mansions you worried
                        about or the popularity you had to live up to but you most certainly will remember whether were
                        you able
                        to live your life the
                        way you wanted, did you reciprocate love to all the qualified people.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It might feel difficult to love in the way explained above and it doesn’t mean we should stop
                        ourselves from loving
                        others until we become perfect in the skill of detachment. No one should run away from loving
                        others or being loved.
                        There have been many surveys which showed that people in love really improved on their PME
                        (Physical, Mental, Emotional)
                        health. It carries countless health benefits, helps you live stress- free, is an antidepressant
                        (I can think of the
                        character Heer from the movie ROCKSTAR). <strong>That’s why when you do something that you love
                            no one
                            can do it better than
                            you.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p> Little by little try to develop the sense of detached love and start living the life that way.
                        Don’t
                        expect perfection in the
                        first go; this <strong> learning has to be perpetual.</strong> Remember detachment is not about
                        not caring for
                        anyone but <strong>caring without
                            expectations and without anchoring your happiness to the person or thing.</strong></p>

                    <p>You can channelize this power of Love to achieve your goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whatever you are today is just because you have been loved by someone directly/indirectly. Love
                        has a great role in
                        shaping your nature, in shaping your life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The world needs Love to improve, it needs energy to undertake lifetime changes, if you want to
                        change something/someone
                        Love is the most smooth and effortless way to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Go Out, Give Love, Get Love. Do not hold yourself back. Use its power to change the world and
                        let it Change you, make
                        you better but remember to be detached still!
                    </p>
