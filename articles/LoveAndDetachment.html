                        <em>“Success isn’t always about ‘greatness’, it’s about consistency. Consistent, hard work gains
                            success”</em>
                    <p>-Dwayne Johnson</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all know the story of a race between a tortoise and a rabbit where the tortoise won
                        (unexpectedly). And we probably
                        also know why it won. Consistency. Do you know how magical this simple principle is and that you
                        can do wonders if apply
                        into life. Consistency is Doing just a bit, but every day.
                        If you have ever seen a traditional well in some village. You must have noticed a crack on a
                        particular spot on the
                        boundary of the well. It is created by the rope which is used to draw the bucket filled with
                        water from that well. Can a
                        simple rope cut a rock/stone? Yes - with consistency everything is possible!

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all want to achieve something that we decided maybe a few months ago or year (s) ago but
                        today, the milestone still
                        looks far. We took a few steps towards the goal and stopped.<strong> Getting excited after
                            listening to
                            motivational speeches is
                            natural but we miss on the struggles and hard work the hero of the motivational story had
                            put to
                            reach that success,
                            real inspiration should come from their hard work. </strong> When we see someone dancing
                        like a pro don’t
                        we immediately wish to
                        dance like him, ‘I wish I could dance like her’ You can also dance like her if you are ready to
                        put the number of hours
                        of practice that dancer is putting in.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We forget behind the scenes of many success stories. <strong> There’s nothing like overnight
                            success.
                            What we call as overnight
                            success is the result of tireless practice one has put into for many years.</strong>
                        When you are trying to be consistent your competition is you. Do you remember when you enrolled
                        for a course on Udemy or
                        anywhere how excited were you to finish the course, have that new learning, grab that
                        certification and feel proud for
                        it. But one week later the excitement diminishes and then you have not completed that course
                        even after a year.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So why are we not able to maintain the pace after goal setting. Let’s work on that. Our energy
                        level is at peak the day
                        we set the goal and we try also, to finish as much as we can. This is where we make mistakes.
                        <strong>The process of achieving a
                            goal is just like growing a plant - it cannot grow half of it’s growth in just one day just
                            because you are ready to
                            water it the whole day.</strong> No! You need to water it everyday and the plant will grow
                        little by
                        little and become a strong
                        tree one day.

                    <p>
                        Let’s look at the phases of habit formation.
                    </p>
                    <ol class="pl-4">
                        <li><strong>Honeymoon Phase/Decelerate your feelings</strong>
                            <p>It is important to check on your emotions/feelings when you are just getting started
                                after setting up a goal. There is
                                no need to overdo on day one. You must stop yourself from getting overly engaged into
                                your goal for 7 days initially.
                                .</p>

                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Fight Through Phase/Maintain the pace</strong>
                            <p>
                                Keep the same pace maintained after 7 days what you had for the initial 7 days. Don’t
                                need to change anything. Just
                                devote the same number of hours you did and keep going. Push yourself if you feel like
                                dropping. Just get up and start.

                            </p>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Second Nature Phase/Accelerate your feelings</strong>

                            <p>
                                Many people fail at this level and go out of the race. Isn’t it a pity that someone
                                failed because they couldn’t do what
                                they had already done for 2 weeks. This is the final lap of being consistent and if you
                                somehow survived, the work will
                                become your habit.


                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="text-center"> <strong> It takes 21 days to build a habit</strong></p>
                    <p>If i had to line graph how you progress in these 21 days it will go something like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/Habit formation.PNG" alt="Habit graph">
                    <p>It is an actual demonstration of overall growth. Growth is massive over the period but only when
                        consistency is
                        maintained. Brushing teeth for 2 mins is not going to make any difference but doing it regularly
                        is surely going to.
                    </p>
                    <p>How can you motivate yourself if you find it difficult to keep going:
                        Sometimes, even if we try hard we leave working on the goal before 21 days and let’s accept this
                        is happening with
                        millions right now. I will suggest some ways which can help you keep going.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong> Find a friend/someone with the same or similar goal.</strong> So there’s a support
                            system for you.
                            They can drag you just in case
                            you think to default.</li>
                        <li> <strong> Follow your role model. </strong> Watch them, listen to them if possible talk to
                            them when you feel
                            you are not continuing
                            anymore.</li>
                        <li><strong> Write your goal everyday with granular details. </strong>This is called the law of
                            attraction - when
                            you think about something in
                            detail, you start working towards it and eventually get it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice positive affirmations.</strong> If you do not feel like getting up and
                            doing what you have
                            decided, think ‘I can do it’,
                            ‘there’s a reason I started this’, ‘I will be an improved person tomorrow’.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Being consistent is a no brainer but an ultimate power. Even the non powerful and non privileged
                        can transform
                        themselves with consistency. Put efforts little by little everyday towards your goal and bring
                        the change you wish to
                        see.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am open for more suggestions and ideas. You can ask questions as well in the comment box below
                        and I will try to
                        answer it in my next blog.</p>
                    <p>Keep smiling!</p>
