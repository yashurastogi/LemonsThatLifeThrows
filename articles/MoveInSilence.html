                        I bet, we all have come across this quotation. This is more than a thought or a quote. It’s a
                        method, it’s a process
                        backed by psychological experiments.
                        We will dive in to see how <strong class="font-weight-bold"> our perspective towards goals
                            change if we
                            tell it to others
                        </strong>
                        and how
                        we can resist ourselves
                        from announcing set goals to the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lemons_that_life_throws/">Instagram</a> story poll
                        to
                        validate if telling your plans to others spoil it or you lose
                        interest once you have told them to others. This is what results looked like:
                        <br>
                        <img src="../img/goals.jpg"
                            style="width: 50%;height: 100%; padding-left:2rem; margin-left: 15rem;" alt="screenshot">
                        <br>
                        72% of the participants felt that it did spoil if they went out and announced their goals and
                        plans. Let’s see the
                        reasons behind this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="font-weight-bold">Why will sharing your goals not let you achieve them?</strong>
                        <br>
                        There are two reasons for this - one is the principal reason (which is inside us) and then
                        there’s a secondary reason
                        that comes from other/external people.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="font-weight-bold"> Reason A: Our Mind </strong>
                        <br>
                        Why is it best to keep our mouth shut when it comes to goals or details about it? You should not
                        even tell it to your
                        closest friends when you are just starting out but you can definitely open up when you have
                        walked the path a little.
                        When you discuss your goal with people they start appreciating you, congratulating you on
                        thinking to start a new
                        venture,
                        <strong class="font-weight-bold"> you receive appreciative messages from lots of people which
                            actually tricks your mind
                            and it starts to think
                            that you have achieved that goal already! </strong> The environment that is built up when
                        you discuss
                        it
                        with people, gives you a
                        feeling of certain achievement while in reality there isn’t anything like that and you have
                        not
                        even taken a step
                        forward towards that goal. When your mind knows that you have already achieved the goal it
                        is
                        less focussed on that.
                        Brain is not putting the amount of energy which is actually needed to achieve the goal and
                        just
                        shifts the attention
                        somewhere else.
                        And this is how your behavior changes, you start paying less attention to your goal, even
                        doing
                        a little bit seems like
                        you have already done a lot towards the goal and are distracted easily.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="font-weight-bold"> Reason B: Vibrations by people

                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        This is the secondary reason that comes into play and stops you from achieving your goal once
                        you shout it out.
                        <br>
                        As soon as you describe it to others they start creating thoughts about it -it can be thoughts
                        of doubt, jealousy,
                        happiness etc. which can interfere with your vibrations of hard work.

                    <p>
                        <strong class="font-weight-bold"> AN EXPERIMENT </strong>
                        You can skip this part if you have watched this <strong class="font-weight-bold"> video
                        </strong>or can watch it right now.

                        There was an experiment conducted where 163 people were asked to write down their goals. Half of
                        them were also asked to
                        announce their goals while the other half kept their mouth shut.
                        Then all 163 people were given tasks to do for 45 minutes which will help them in directly
                        achieving their goals. They
                        were also told that they can stop whenever they want.
                        <br>It was observed that the group who had announced it’s goal worked for 33 minutes on average
                        and
                        felt that they worked a
                        lot towards their goal. The other group who had kept their goals to themselves worked for the
                        entire 45 minutes and felt
                        that they needed to do a lot to achieve the goals.
                        <br>
                        It is proved through this experiment that telling others your plan will actually spoil it. We
                        have already seen why this
                        happens:
                        <br> Reason A) our own mind is tricked into the feeling that we have achieved the goal.
                        <br> Reason B) The vibration from
                        other people.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="font-weight-bold"> But how can you resist and not tell your goals? </strong><br>
                        I can understand that whenever we set a new goal we want to boast it off and collect some
                        appreciation, want to be
                        applauded etc, and this is purely psychological. Next time when you feel like discussing your
                        next mission badly with
                        others try below tips to avoid:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="font-weight-bold"> Write it down. </strong> When there is an inner desire to
                            discuss your goal, choose to write it
                            instead. Writing will take you
                            deeper with that goal and you will understand the aspects which were so far hidden. After
                            writing down you will feel
                            proud of yourself and will have a great satisfaction but if you discuss it out you will feel
                            as an energy- drained
                            person.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="font-weight-bold"> Reward Yourself. </strong> Soon after achieving your goal
                            or an important milestone of a bigger goal,
                            pamper yourself. Order your
                            favourite ice cream, watch the flick who you have been waiting for. This way you can keep
                            yourself happy and motivated
                            to keep working towards your mission. By this you even get a break from your routine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="font-weight-bold">Never Boast off.</strong> Be grounded whether you are
                            working on something unique or not. There can
                            still be hundreds of people
                            doing the same thing. Set yourself as a standard and evaluate yourself against that. Read
                            that again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong class="font-weight-bold"> Break down. </strong> Breaking your goals into smaller
                            doable pieces
                            has many benefits. First of all,
                            the mind is not overwhelmed
                            by the size of the goal. And step by step you reach that bigger goal. You get
                            satisfaction
                            from achieving something
                            smaller while you are on the way to achieve that big goal.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next time when you decide a goal for yourself, <strong class="font-weight-bold"> move in silence
                            and let the news of your success
                            reach others. </strong>
