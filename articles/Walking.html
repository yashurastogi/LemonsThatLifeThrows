                    <p>
                        It took me more than 2 months before I could walk again after a very simple slip from the
                        stairs. The moment I slipped
                        the only thought that came across was, “It is just an ankle sprain and nothing major”, I was
                        trying to suppress my gut
                        feel. But an x-ray shattered my hopes. My foot had a fracture. Before this I never had faced any
                        fracture or major
                        illness which required hospitalisation. But I always used to fear accidents and fractures. My
                        fear was shaking hands
                        with me.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Doctor put on a plaster and asked me to visit him after a week. An x-ray upon my second visit
                        did not look promising and
                        the doctor said it requires screw fixation via surgery. I was shaken again. I didn’t trust the
                        doctor (looks like I was
                        not ready to accept such a bad luck of mine) and took the opinion from 3 more docs but they all
                        had the same opinion,
                        “This type of bone fracture cannot be fixed with surgery.”


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The day of surgery was fixed after a number of tests (this was the first time I was undergoing a
                        surgery). It all went
                        well. My recovery started from there. And now I have started walking properly after 4+ months. I
                        started with gently
                        with partial weight on my foot but my journey from that day of slip till today taught me many
                        lessons which are worth
                        knowing for all of us.


                    <ol>
                        <li> <strong>Being hopeful and mentally strong:</strong>
                            <br>The hope that it’s going to be alright is as required as any medicine in such scenarios.
                            Being mentally and emotionally
                            strong helps in coping up with the worst situations. I am not saying you will get into such
                            a situation but if you do
                            keep faith and you will come out of those. Accidents can be major or minor but when you are
                            going through such a phase,
                            mental stability is foremost.You may find that people who love you may become more worried
                            than you yourself but you
                            need to tell them that it’s going to get fine.

                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Patience is the key</strong>

                            <br>Being in bed for several weeks is something that no one is used to. When you are eagerly
                            waiting for your recovery lying
                            on that bed you want to be on your feet any moment. But good things take time and everything
                            has a process, everything.
                            You can bypass the process in some places but with body you simply cannot. It will take it’s
                            time and you must be
                            patient. If you are a patient, be patient (tolerant). This never fails, I have personally
                            experienced it.

                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Gratitude</strong>
                            <br>Expressing gratitude is never out of fashion. You may realise this on the face when you
                            are in a bad situation. We take
                            our body for granted but remember it’s a blessing to have a perfectly working body.
                            Sometimes we need to lose a thing to
                            know it’s value. Show respect and value while you are using something that can be gone any
                            moment. Nothing is yours, you
                            are because of things. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CPqRDLPHNMZ/">Watch this small
                                video on gratitude. </a>

                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Family members are gems</strong>
                            <br>You can’t be lucky enough if you have loving and caring family members. When I was lying
                            in bed there were people who
                            were running for my medicines, medical tests, food, for doctors etc. Then at home I had my
                            sisters who took care of
                            everything. Every household chore you can think of for my maintenance. Never take people who
                            love you for granted and
                            return the favors however you can.

                        <li> <strong>Opportunity to look at a life from different lens</strong>
                            <br>I had plenty of time in my hands when my foot was healing and I could not walk. That
                            gave me enough space to try
                            something new. I utilised the time to start <a
                                href="https://www.instagram.com/lemons_that_life_throws/"> this Instagram account</a> .
                            I was
                            not on Instagram
                            till then. It was a
                            completely new experience for me and I am happy that I started it then and am still
                            continuing it. If you are not
                            connected with me there, let’s connect and share life experiences. I started reading books
                            again after a long pause.
                            This all suggests that you should be open to new ventures and have multiple passions.

                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Your circumstances do not define you</strong>
                            <br>Circumstances keep changing and whether good or bad they cannot define you. You should
                            have a stable perspective of your
                            life no matter what may come. Do not dwindle on life. If you visualize yourself as xyz, keep
                            working towards that dream
                            person, nothing in between should affect. Experiences you have in your life are unique to
                            you and after every new
                            experience you are not the person you were before. Whether you tried bungee jumping for the
                            first time or you met with
                            an accident, that experience is personal to you and your self confidence boosts if you have
                            managed to come through the
                            circumstances.



                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Fear goes away</strong>
                            <br>Before this incident I used to fear accidents and surgeries a lot (I think most of us
                            do) but when I was into the
                            situation I had kind of lived it and once you live your fear it doesn’t exist anymore. You
                            fear until you try. I still
                            hate accidents but I know if I ever have to face it again I will come through. I know the
                            process now:)
                            If you are also fearing something, try to live it and fear will go away. In the words of,
                            <strong> “
                                Always do what you are
                                afraid to do” </strong>


                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel</strong>
                            <br>No matter how ugly your time is you just need to hang a bit longer to see that ray of
                            light. Victory comes in the most
                            difficult hour of all the hours of your journey. I think good days and successful life is a
                            reward for people who kept
                            going and had their flags of positivity always on.



                        </li>

                    <p>
                        These lessons might look like big ones, but trust me I have realised all these and some more of
                        them just being in that
                        phase. I shared these for all of you to realise how precious this life is and how important it
                        is to be happy whatever
                        your situation is. Maybe you are sad because you don’t have a good pair of shoes, think about
                        the person who lost his
                        leg. Don’t you have a reason to be happy?
                    </p>
