                    <p>
                        I became PMP certified in October 2022 and that became by far the best achievement of that year.
                        While this certification is one of the most prestigious for folks into the Project Management
                        world the assessment is
                        one of the brain-teasing ones.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong style="font-weight:600"> Exam Pattern:</strong> <br>

                        The PMP exam will be a 4 hour exam with total of 200 questions. These 200 questions fall under
                        different categories
                        defined by PMI. All are multiple-choice questions. You can visit PMI website for more details.
                        You
                        will find a detailed
                        Handbook on the website with all the updates and about the course.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I have to break down my entire journey of becoming PMP certified I would divide it into two
                        phases –
                        <strong style="font-weight:600">
                            Learning and
                            Practice.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center" style="font-weight:600">

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started prepping for this esteemed exam in December 2021 but I put myself into it with whole
                        seriousness from April
                        2022. Since I already had a job I had my limited time of day (night actually) and the weekends
                        with me. But daily
                        learning will lead you there.

                    <p>
                        <strong style="font-weight:600"> The Course I took:</strong> <br>

                        I took a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-pmbok6-35-pdus/" style="font-weight:600"
                            target="_blank">
                            course on Udemy by Joseph
                            Phillips</a>
                        which also gives you 35
                        Professional Development Units (PDUs) required for the application of this exam. I did go
                        through the reviews before
                        buying this course for some INR 500. I started watching the lectures every day and made notes in
                        Microsoft Word as typed
                        notes are easy to edit, add or remove the content when you are revisiting these notes.
                        I found this Udemy course very well organized and it covered all the topics in the proper
                        sequence as of PMBOK. PMI is
                        the apex body/institute which releases Project management Book of Knowledg (PMBOK) at an
                        interval of few years and each
                        version will have changes here and there in the topics and concepts. I found this Udemy course
                        well-updated with the
                        recent changes in PMBOK.
                        This is a big question among the aspirants whether the course they are looking for will fulfill
                        the latest patterns, but
                        trust me these are the top-ranked courses and they keep updating the course to be in sync with
                        the changing patterns of
                        the exam. I know there are other courses and platforms available costing 10K INR or even more
                        but this exam, I felt, is
                        more of self-practice and having a guide or point of contact to solve your queries will suffice.
                        But it’s up to you to
                        decide based on what suits you best.

                        <strong style="font-weight:600">Focus on Agile Methodology while you are learning:</strong> <br>

                        Agile Practices have been emphasized a lot in the new PMBOK and a lot of exam questions are
                        skewed a lot towards Agile
                        in project management hence you will not find many questions on traditional/waterfall methods of
                        project management and
                        this needs to be kept in mind while you are preparing for it.
                        Close to 80% of the questions that I faced were on the Agile Project Management so if you want
                        to excel in this
                        certification, Agile is the new way out! I did not had any proper practical experience of Agile
                        style of project
                        management hence I found it entirely new concept and took some time to learn and brush up those
                        topics. Now after
                        preparing for the exam I have a very good understanding of how Agile framework works. So even if
                        you are new to Agile or
                        have never practiced it still you can learn and excel in this exam.
                        Once you have gone through all the lectures it’s time to jump into the battlefield of Mock tests
                        or let’s say PRACTICE.

                        <strong style="font-weight:600"> The Mock Tests I took:</strong> <br>

                        After completing the course I purchased two Mocks on Udemy <a
                            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-exam-situational-question-practice-test-200-q-pmbok6/"

                            style="font-weight:600" target="_blank">
                            Mock Test 2</a>.
                        Once you start giving mock tests your life should be:

                        <img src="../img/PMP snapshot.PNG" alt="PMP Matrix">
                        Mocks after mocks you will realize that your understanding has improved a lot and how the topics
                        you have studied are
                        applied in the actual life when you are working on the projects.
                        <strong style="font-weight:600"> Few Things to keep in mind when you start giving Mock
                            Tests:</strong> <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Do not be overwhelmed by the number of questions. The Mocks that I listed above will give
                            you a good idea of the
                            actual exam and will build your stamina to sit for 4-hour long assessment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will find the options given very close and there you will have to use your deep
                            learnings to find the difference
                            between the options to choose the right one. <strong> It’s common to
                                feel that all options are
                                correct, but of course, they are
                                not.</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>It is fine if you are not passing the Mock tests</strong>
                            It is fine if you are not passing the Mock tests as per the threshold defined. As a
                            matter of fact I could not pass
                            any of the mock tests in the first attempt. But you will learn a lot in this process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Do re-attempt </strong>the tests after some time to know how much you have learned
                            and revise the
                            concepts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can note down or take and save snapshots for some of the trickiest questions to
                            revise them as a refresher.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If possible discuss the questions and options with your peers or someone else preparing
                            for the exam to retain that
                            in your mind for long
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Maintain notes and keep revising.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    I also took help from some of the Youtube channels, though you will not find many channels talking
                    about this exam. I
                    watched and practiced from these channels:

                    <ol>
                        <li>What you will learn while going through the course is one aspect and what’s asked in the
                            exam is another aspect in
                            terms of application of the knowledge. Hence Mocks are critical to show your readiness.</li>
                        <li>
                            While answering the questions always wear the PMI hat, what it means is that you need to
                            think the way PMI describes
                            the situation not the way you see it happening or you think it should happen. Many times,
                            you will find that reality is
                            different from the right answer.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>That’s about it. Perseverance is the key for this exam. For me it took some 8 months to learn and
                        give an attempt for
                        others it can be less depends how much you already know, how much time you can devote, etc. Once
                        you are fully prepped
                        go for the exam without any gap and you will come out with shining colors.</p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks for the read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep smiling .
