                    people can’t finish
                    one file the whole day? The answer is distractions.`

        Karma is when we think, do or speak. All voluntary actions are Karma. “Naa bura bolo, naa bura socho, naa bura karo” which translates to “do not speak bad, do not think bad, do not do bad” explains how Karma should be to a great extent. Karma is not just our actions but it starts at the thought level. What we think or intend to do generates Karma.

I bet, we all have come across this quotation. This is more than a thought or a quote. It’s a method, it’s a process backed by psychological experiments.
We will dive in to see how our perspective towards goals change if we tell it to others and how we can resist ourselves from announcing set goals to the world.

                            trying to suppress my gut
                            feel.  But an x-ray shattered my hopes. My foot had a fracture. Before this I never had faced any
                            fracture or major
                            illness which required hospitalisation. But I always used to fear accidents and fractures. My
                            fear was shaking hands
                            with me.
