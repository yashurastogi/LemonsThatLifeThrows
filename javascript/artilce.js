                    Colleague: “That’s the thing, it is not too big. I could have easily finished it today”

                    Have you ever been in a situation as my colleague above? At least I have been. So why do you think
                    people can’t finish
                    one file the whole day? The answer is distractions.`

                        liking their ways and your rhyming goes well with them it can be misunderstood as love. It may
                        or may not be love, it
                        can be attachment and people can confuse that with love.`

        Karma is when we think, do or speak. All voluntary actions are Karma. “Naa bura bolo, naa bura socho, naa bura karo” which translates to “do not speak bad, do not think bad, do not do bad” explains how Karma should be to a great extent. Karma is not just our actions but it starts at the thought level. What we think or intend to do generates Karma.
