                    still I am only half
                    done.”
                    <br>
                    Me: “Is it too big to finish in a day?”
                    <br>
                    Colleague: “That’s the thing, it is not too big. I could have easily finished it today”
                    
                    <br>

                    Have you ever been in a situation as my colleague above? At least I have been. So why do you think
                    people can’t finish
                    one file the whole day? The answer is distractions.`
